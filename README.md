# APIEvolutionSurveyPapers
A repository of primary studies and filtering to obtain primary studies for an API Evolution Survey

## Instructions
All documents were obtained by using the exact search phrase "API Evolution" (Using quotation marks, and in a single string).
This search phrase was used with the following online publishers:

	* ACM Digital Library
	* Elsevier Science Direct
	* IEEE Xplore Digital Library
	* Springer Online Library
	* Wiley Online Library

A follow-up search was also done with Google Scholar, using the same search phrase, and by using the [Publish or Perish tool.](https://harzing.com/resources/publish-or-perish)

These searches presented some duplicate results, which were removed by a simple string matching of the titles.
The remainder of the papers were filtered manually with the following criteria:

	* Studies must be written in English
	* Studies must be related to the field of computer science or software engineering
	* Studies should have a relation to API evolution
	* Studies must not be a Master or PhD thesis
	* Studies must be fully available from one or more online library
	* Studies must be published between January 1st 1994 and January 1st 2021
	
We do not limit our search by publication venue (All conferences, journals, and magazines that are available from these sources were accepted)
The complete list of papers selected for our API Evolution study can be found in the file "" in this repository.

Our approach may have missed some papers that indeed do represent the field. If one of your papers was not used, we sincerely apologize.
